Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Uber:

Given a list of numbers, find if there exists a pythagorean triplet in that list. A pythagorean triplet is 3 variables a, b, c where a^2 + b^2 = c^2

Example:
Input: [3, 5, 12, 5, 13]
Output: True
Here, 5^2 + 12^2 = 13^2.

def findPythagoreanTriplets(nums):
  # Fill this in.

print findPythagoreanTriplets([3, 12, 5, 13])
# True
